//Use the best kind of loop (for, while, for of) for each challenge.
//Practice 1: Create a loop that runs through each item in the fruits array.

const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

for (const fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}

// Practice 2: Create a loop that runs as long as i is less than 22, but increase i with 2 each time.

for (let i = 0; i < 22; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
};
